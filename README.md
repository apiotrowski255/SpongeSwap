Amita's feedback - 23/12/2020:

Story/Plot: 
- "What exactly the fuck is going on?" is legitimate first thought that comes to mind. Nothing is explained, you're just sorta randomly button mashing because absolutely nothing is explained about what the purpose, story or end goal of the game is. Just fight spongebob, but absolutely no explanation of how. Not a good start. Button mash, pray and then die. Either when you give the game to other people to play, include some sort of instructions BEFORE they play so they have some idea of what the game experience is supposed to be about, or have a menu somewhere that explains controls and user objective. 
- Assuming we're playing as plankton, how are we already on level 19? Also what level is spongebob? 
- What the hell even do act and mercy options do like I don't see any visible difference in what happens if you choose either of them. What is their purpose? Do they have one? If they don’t why do they exist? 

User Experience: 
- Again, what exactly is the user experience meant to be? Game kinda just feels like a bit of a shit, not really well thought out version of turn based pokemon fight that's currently impossible. 
- If you're looking for fun, you need to dig a bit deeper because right now it's feeling like a "lets take some elements from other games, slap it together and call it a game!!!" 

Controls: 
- Why does wsad not work as expected when trying to choose an item - not very intuitive since almost every other menu option is controlled by regular wsad. LET ME CHOOSE UP AND DOWN TOO GODDAMN IT. A -= 1, D += 1, what she wants is W -= 2, S += 2
- Up/down keys to change gravity while in blue state would have been nice to have known about earlier -> you are not suppose to know that.


Mechanics: 
- Why are there two states for the hearts??? What is the purpose?? Is it something to do with when you can destroy spongebob or what?? Like pacman? Does it add towards player experience? 
- The bubble ring thing is literally impossible to avoid - big dislike until collision thing is fixed thanks. Alternatively, maybe don’t have such a MASSIVE number of waves for like the first time the player encounters it?
- Add a projectile or some way to like to destroy the bubbles or something instead of just some stupid mad dodgem 
- IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR THE OCTOPI TO SPAWN WITHIN THE SPACE OF PLAY. big angy because you've already limited player agency and now the spawner is INSIDE the space as well and it's ANNOYING to have even LESS space in an already VERY CRAMPED SPACE OK. -> increase distance between player and jellyFish

Performance: 
- Game shat itself when I had it running in the background while I was trying to read through your git files 
Also ended up just shitting itself when I tried to close it in the middle of the game - did NOT like that at all. -> This could be related to the audio cleanUp

Audio: 
- LMAO if I hold down the gravity keys it makes a godawful screech when spongebob changes gravity and you can't force it back. -> Pressing arrow keys changes the gravity. This needs to be removed. 
- Three noises layered up on each other after first round of red heart makes it v hard to hear when you've been hit since the bg music itself is very loud, then you have entrance noises for the octopi, AND damage noise when you get hit? this is too much, worse still if you're trying to have them as audio cues. Either get rid of one of the sounds or dramatically lower that background volume. 
- Background music is far too loud - I've got my headphones at like 2 and it's still rather loud tbh. Either tone it down or allow for just a temp mute option please.

Other: 
- No clear ending as to when each round finishes - this needs to be fixed because from a player perspective it's infuriating to have the round finish before all the bubbles/whatever disappear from the screen. LET THE SCREEN BE CLEAR BEFORE THE NEXT ROUND.  
- Also no real way to hit spongebob - have I missed something because no matter where I hit enter in the sideways krabby patty slider, everything is missed. 
-  have seen TODO re: collisions so won't comment since that's already been recognised

if version 1.2
typo fixes:
- It's "weighing" not "weighting" 
- It's also *K*rabby patty
